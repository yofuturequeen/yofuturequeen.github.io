          <h2>Overview and Usage</h2>
          <p>This chrome extension allows users to choose a new background color
            for whichever website of their choice. It contains 3 color pickers that 
            have a preset theme to select from or users can choose to preset another 
            theme of colors. This gives users the opportunity to set a theme for all
            the websites they visit! <br>

          <h2>Development Process</h2>
          <ul>
            <b>Getting Started</b>
            <li>Read up on Javascript and the DOM</li>
            <li>Practiced snippets of Javascript code</li><br>
            <b>Understanding Examples</b>
            <li>Downloaded and cloned extension tool kit from class</li>
            <li>Went line by line for background-colorizer example to Understanding
                what each line meant</li>
            <li>Learned how to use chrome storage</li><br>
            <b>Building Off Example</b>
            <li>Added 2 more color pickers</li>
            <li>Added checkboxes that would allow users to choose between color pickers</li>
            <li>Set a preset theme</li>
            <li>Added custom styling to popup such as changing the buttons and title</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Issue Deep Dive</h2>
          <p>For this mini project, I had to learn basically everything with no previous knowledge
            of using Javascript or the DOM. This was really difficult for me because it took a lot of time
            to understand what the examples have done and also what the capabilities are for Javascript. 
            Because of this steep learning curve, I had a lot of logic issues. One of them being figuring out
            how to make the checkbox send a message to the content script. I learned how to use console.log to figure out what 
            was and what wasn't working. Another thing I learned along the way was the syntax for writing functions
            and how to navigate the scope of certain variables. I also learned how to cross reference my variables 
            and id names across content scripts, html, and javascript.
          </p>
          <h2>Ideas & Future Work</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Rather than 3 color pickers, being able to choose a color and the other 2 are random 
                colors that are within the same theme (hue, saturation, etc.)
            </li>
            <li>Changing the background to a gif</li>
            <li>Try making a browser extension that changes the cursor into a cute shape or animation</li>
          </ul>
