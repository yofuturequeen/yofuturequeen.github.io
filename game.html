          <p>For this assignment, 2 sites that were really helpful to use as reference were the <a href="https://p5play.org/learn/index.html">p5 play website</a>
             where they work through the necessary components to make a game and the other being Allison Parrish's <a href="https://creative-coding.decontextualize.com/making-games-with-p5-play/">Making Games with
                p5.play</a>. There was also an abundance of games people have made that were available online that I used to point me in a certain direction. The 
                example that was similar to my game that I used as reference can be found <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/amazingsupergirl98/sketches/v2gp7hzZ1">here</a>.
