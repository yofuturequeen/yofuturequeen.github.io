          <h2>Overview and Usage</h2>
          <p>This game is called Strawberraroll. It features my favorite Sanrio character 
            Cinnamaroll. Users play as Cinnamaroll to collect strawberries and flours to bake a 
            cake. Don't collect the poison though! Or your game will be over. You can play my game

          <h2>Development and Process</h2>
          <ul>
            <b>Getting Started</b>
            <li>Read up on p5 play library to understand features</li>
            <li>Looked at example games to see what components I would need</li><br>
            <b>Creating Bare Bones Game</b>
            <li>Made Cinnamaroll move with mouse</li>
            <li>Created strawberry object that would collect</li>
            <li>Made background to look like it moves</li><br>
            <b>Adding Details</b>
            <li>Made strawberries appear randomly and move off screen</li>
            <li>Added flour and poison</li>
            <li>Created end condition for the game</li><br>
            <b>Deploying</b>
            <li>Transferred all files from web editor to VS code</li>
            <li>Used web dev tools to run locally</li>
            <li>Deployed game to github pages</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
          <p>I ran into a lot of problems with this game. The most prominent issue having to do with 
            removing objects once they've touched/overlapped. I think this issue had to do with logic 
            as every time Cinnamaroll would overlap a strawberry, nothing would happen. I looked at tons 
            of examples online and actually copied over the syntax from the reference to remove the strawberry. 
            For the life of me, I could not figure out why it wouldn't work. I tried rewriting the code to accomplish 
            this fundamental task at least 10 times. I would get errors like remove not being a function or the overlap 
            simply not working which was really frusturating. Finally though, one of my methods worked and the 
            strawberries would remove. Even now, I don't understand what I was doing wrong but at least it works!

          <h2>Ideas and Future Work</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Add music and sound effects to game
            </li>
            <li>Create a number of cakes depending on user score</li>
            <li>Make the game start easy and gradually get harder</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Kudos</h2>
          <p>For this assignment, 2 sites that were really helpful to use as reference were the <a href="https://p5play.org/learn/index.html">p5 play website</a>
             where they work through the necessary components to make a game and the other being Allison Parrish's <a href="https://creative-coding.decontextualize.com/making-games-with-p5-play/">Making Games with
                p5.play</a>. There was also an abundance of games people have made that were available online that I used to point me in a certain direction. The 
                example that was similar to my game that I used as reference can be found <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/amazingsupergirl98/sketches/v2gp7hzZ1">here</a>.
