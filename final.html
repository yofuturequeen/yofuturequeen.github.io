          <h2>Overview and Usage</h2>
          <p>This game is called Strawberraroll and is the final version of my game. Play as 
            Sanrio's Cinnamaroll and collect strawberries and flour to create a cake! Make sure to avoid 
            the poison or your cake will be ruined. Strawberraroll gets increasingly harder as you continue to 
            play and players can keep track of their high scores with a leaderboard.

          <h2>Development and Process</h2>
          <ul>
            <b>Getting Started</b>
            <li>Walked through Firebase examples</li>
            <li>Tested prototype version to determine if difficulty of game needs improvement</li><br>
            <b>Improved Existing Game</b>
            <li>Added all characters/images back into game</li>
            <li>Adjusted characters and background to match fuller screen game</li>
            <li>Fixed the problem of poison not collecting upon overlap with 100% accuracy</li><br>
            <b>Adding New Functionality</b>
            <li>Made the game increasingly harder every 30 seconds</li>
            <li>Added a leaderboard using Firebase</li>
            <li>Added styling to game screens and leaderboard</li><br>
            <b>Deploying</b>
            <li>Transferred all files from web editor to VS code</li>
            <li>Used web dev tools to run locally</li>
            <li>Deployed game to github pages</li>
            <li>Fixed the bugs that came with deploying game</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
          <p>The biggest problem I ran into for finishing up this game was adding Firebase. I would say 
            this was mainly logic error as I felt completely unfamiliar with using it and adding to my existing code. 
            With Firebase, there are a lot of components that link together and I think it was most difficult for me to 
            figure out what should in which file. What I mean by this is differentiating what needs to go in my html file vs 
            js file and then learning how they should commmunicate with one another.
          </p>
          <h2>Ideas and Future Work</h2>
          <p>I'm honestly very satisfied with this game and don't think I would add much else to improve it. Instead, I'll 
            give examples of things I'd want to create from the skills I learned in this class!
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Create some kind of logic math game like 2048!</li>
            <li>Revisit my browser extension and attempt creating a new one</li>
            <li>Make an audio visualizer that can take in any song and produce new patterns depending on rhythm and beat</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Kudos</h2>
          <p>For this assignment, I used Hannah's <a href="https://github.com/branchwelder/web-technologies/blob/main/activities/09_firebase.md">in class Firebase example</a> to understand Firebase better. I also
            used <a href="https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/build-leaderboards-with-firestore#0">Google's documentation</a> for adding leaderboards to games. Lastly, Arissa Zhang helped me a great deal 
            in implementing a leaderboard. Thank you Arissa!
