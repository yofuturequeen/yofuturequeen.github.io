          <h2>Proposal and Prototype</h2>
          <p>
            For my final project I produced a <a href="./proposal.html">proposal</a> and <a href="./prototype.html">prototype</a> before completing this final version.
            Check them out!
          </p>
          <h2>Overview and Usage</h2>
          <p>This game is called Strawberraroll and is the final version of my game. Play as 
            Sanrio's Cinnamaroll and collect strawberries and flour to create a cake! Make sure to avoid 
            the poison or your cake will be ruined. Strawberraroll gets increasingly harder as you continue to 
            play so be extra careful.

          <h2>Development and Process</h2>
          <ul>
            <b>Getting Started</b>
            <li>Walked through Firebase examples</li>
            <li>Tested prototype version to determine if difficulty of game needs improvement</li><br>
            <b>Improved Existing Game</b>
            <li>Added all characters/images back into game</li>
            <li>Adjusted characters and background to match fuller screen game</li>
            <li>Fixed the problem of poison not collecting upon overlap with 100% accuracy</li><br>
            <b>Adding New Functionality</b>
            <li>Made the game increasingly harder every 30 seconds</li>
            <li>Attempted to add a leaderboard using Firebase</li>
            <li>Added styling to game screens </li><br>
            <b>Deploying</b>
            <li>Transferred all files from web editor to VS code</li>
            <li>Used web dev tools to run locally</li>
            <li>Deployed game to github pages</li>
            <li>Fixed the bugs that came with deploying game</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
          <p>The biggest problem I ran into for finishing up this game was adding Firebase. I would say 
            this was mainly logic error as I felt completely unfamiliar with using it and adding to my existing code. 
            With Firebase, there are a lot of components that link together and I think it was most difficult for me to 
            figure out what should in which file. What I mean by this is differentiating what needs to go in my html file vs 
            js file and then learning how they should commmunicate with one another. In the end, I tried for a very long time 
            to implement a leaderboard using peers and online work but it did not work out and would consistently crash 
            my game. A large part of this is due to the fact that I still don't have the best understanding of javascript outside 
            of making games. I will attempt to revisit this but I simply could not figure this out. You can take a look at my attempted 
            code in my firebase.js file.
          </p>
          <h2>Ideas and Future Work</h2>
          <p>I'm honestly very satisfied with this game and don't think I would add much else to improve it besides the leaderboard. Instead, I'll 
            give examples of things I'd want to create from the skills I learned in this class!
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Create some kind of logic math game like 2048!</li>
            <li>Revisit my browser extension and attempt creating a new one</li>
            <li>Make an audio visualizer that can take in any song and produce new patterns depending on rhythm and beat</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Kudos</h2>
          <p>For this assignment, I used Hannah's <a href="https://github.com/branchwelder/web-technologies/blob/main/activities/09_firebase.md">in class Firebase example</a> to understand Firebase better. I also
            used <a href="https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/build-leaderboards-with-firestore#0">Google's documentation</a> for adding leaderboards to games. Lastly, Arissa, Nikta, and Yuming tried to help me by 
            sending me their repositories.
