          <h1 class="header">Final Prototype Writeup</h1>
          <h2>Overview and Usage</h2>
          <p>This game is my Strawberraroll Prototype. This is a prototype for my final project which means 
            while it is functional, it doesn't have all the bells and whistles my final version will have. 
            Since it builds off my original game, the prototype version contains some new functionality.
            You can play my game prototype

          <h2>Development and Process</h2>
          <ul>
            <b>Getting Started</b>
            <li>Looked and played other peoples' games</li>
            <li>Thought of future steps and qualities I could add to my game to improve it</li>
            <li>Submitted proposal for final project</li><br>
            <b>Small Alterations to Original Game</b>
            <li>Replaced characters/images with basic sprites</li>
            <li>Made the game full screen</li>
            <li>Fixed the problem of original game where not all sprites would be collected</li><br>
            <b>Adding New Functionality</b>
            <li>Added sound: Sound effects for different events and game soundtrack</li>
            <li>Created an animation of a cake being made and added it to end screen</li>
            <li>Made it so game could be reset upon click rather than refresh</li><br>
            <b>Deploying</b>
            <li>Transferred all files from web editor to VS code</li>
            <li>Used web dev tools to run locally</li>
            <li>Deployed game to github pages</li>
            <li>Fixed the bugs that came with deploying game</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
          <p>The biggest problem I ran into for this prototype version was getting all the functionality to work upon 
            ending the game. An issue here was my animation only playing for a split second when the poison was touched. 
            This is because the draw loop would continue meaning my animation would only play for one frame. I also tried 
            to remove all sprites with end condition which didn't work properly either. This was a logic error and to fix 
            this I created entirely different screens depending on which stage the user was on (start, in game, game over).
          </p>
          <h2>Ideas and Future Work</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Add the background and all the characters and items back to the game</li>
            <li>Use Firebase to add a log in to keep track of high scores</li>
            <li>Add stylized text for game over and start screens</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Further Questions</h2>
          <h3>Project Scope</h3>
          <p>For my final project I added the idea of adding Firebase to my game to advance my game and make it a bit more 
            complex. I also added different screens depending on what stage of the game I'm on which is a new change for my final.
            However, I don't think I will be able to add different characters unless I have ample time 
            after completing all my other changes.
          </p>
          <h3>Time Management</h3>
          <p>While I didn't neccessarily predict which issues I would run into, I knew I would run into a lot. I anticipated getting 
            stuck quite often and that's exactly what happened. It felt like even making the smallest of changes would then turn me to a 
            whole new set of problems which was really frustrating. Getting stuck on one small line of code for an entire work session 
            definitely added more time to my completion as well.
          </p>
          <h3>Implementation Plan</h3>
          <p>For my final version, besides the changes I listed above, I will also run my game on my web dev server much more often. One part 
            of this process I found quite time consuming is debugging my deployments so I will be sure to run that more often and earlier.

          <h2>Kudos</h2>
          <p>For this assignment, I used similar references to my original game. The main site that was really helpful to use as reference was the <a href="https://p5play.org/learn/index.html">p5 play website</a>. I also used the <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.sound">p5 sound
            website </a> as reference
             where they work through the necessary components to make a game, load animations, and use sound. Also, kudos to Tammy for helping me figure out how to make different game screens like in her game.
