          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>I approached this assignment by first reading all recommened readings pertaining to: HTML, CSS, files, etc.
            Next, I looked through the example website to understand what each element does. After reviewing these materials
            I started on my site. I copied over the code from the example sites keeping pieces like the image buttons while
            removing things like formatting and inputting my own photos and information. Lastly, I cleaned up the CSS a bit
            in accordance to how I wanted my site to look. I've attached a snip of my unfinished landing page that lacked
            proper labels and had less style.

          <h2>Issue</h2>
          <p>I think the hardest part about creating this site is understanding how to reference to the CSS sheet or
            other files from the HTML file. I have a hard time navigating to the files using ./ or // or no slashes at all.
            Once I've referenced the style sheet though, I still need to be really thorough that I'm referencing the proper
            objects across my CSS and HTML. I originally had a CSS sheet for each page but realized it'd be difficult to keep
            track of. Now, I just need more practice using HTML and CSS to become more familiar with it. 
          </p>
          <h2>CSS Transition</h2>
          <p>For my CSS transition I decided to make my buttons jiggle. I chose this transition because I thought it was pretty
            cool that you can make something look like it jiggles by using less time in the transition and just moving the object
            ever so slightly.

          <h2>Ideas & Future</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Create a navigation bar up top for About Me and Cheatsheets</li>
            <li>Change the project buttons so on hover, the image is different</li>
            <li>Add more images and maybe even videos</li>
            <li>Play around with other transitions</li>
          </ul>
