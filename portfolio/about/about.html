          Hello! My name is Lauren Nguyen and I'm a senior at the University of
          Washington studying Human Centered Design and Engineering. I was born and raised
          in Seattle, Washington. I want to work as
          a UX designer for a few years and then pursue project management. Outside of academics I enjoy
          staying active, traveling and trying new hobbies!
