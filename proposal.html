          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>For my final project I will be revisiting my game miniproject Strawberraroll. This game will be updated in a variety of ways 
            including incorporating a new library (p5 sound) by adding a soundtrack, adding animations, and making the game restart upon click. 
          </p>
          <h2>Prototype vs Final</h2>
          <h3>Prototype Version</h3>
          <p>The prototype version will be how I test out a lot of the new functionality I want to add. This version will not have all of the 
            complete parts such as the strawberries and characters. However, it'll have core functionality like adding a sound effect when a sprite 
            overlaps another. The prototype version will also be where I learn how to make animations such as making a cake using the ingredients collected 
            at the end of the game. 
          </p>
          <h3>Final Version</h3>
          <p>The final version of my game will have all the new functionality using the actual characters and game pieces. It will include pieces I design 
            on my own such as the text for game over and high scores. The game will also take up user's entire screens which it does not currently. Lastly a piece 
            I want to add to the game is making it progressively get harder as the user continues to play.
