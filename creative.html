          <h2>Overview and Usage</h2>
          <p> These 6 sketches were created using p5.js web editor. The first 4 sketches built off one another
             starting with a static sketch, followed by a random sketch, an infinite sketch, and a interactive sketch.
             These sketches feature Benjamin the Bear. The last 2 sketches contain audio and visual qualities and 
             feature Benjamin the baby. <br> <br>
             This gif features Benjamin's ascension to alienhood <br> <br>

          <h2>Development Process</h2>
          <p>For my development process I will go further into depth for my interactive sketch.
            With every sketch, I started by watching a bunch of coding train videos and read
            the relevant reference sheets. For this sketch I referenced the shapes I used, mouse interactivity, and random. <br> <br> After
            learning some new functionality, I copied over my original bear sketch from my static sketch. Writing code
            is something that does not come naturally for me so I had actually started each sketch
            by mapping out and hard coding every point. For this sketch I did that for the light up buttons on 
            the UFO and the light beam that comes off of it. After doing that, I was able to determine what the patterns are between each shape. Once
            I can see the pattern, I then am able to write it into a for loop. It turns out it would've been much faster to make the location for the UFO
            relevant to the mouse position in the first place. <br> <br> With this sketch, I also drew from my 
            previous sketch of using the random function to make the UFO light up. I then learned the difference between
            mouseIsPressed and the mousePressed() function and deemed that the mouseIsPressed made more sense for this sketch.
            After playing around with different colors and locations, I was satisfied with my sketch!
            <br> <br>Below I attached an image of the UFO before the random lights and while it was still in a fixed position <br><br>

          <h2>Issue Deep Dive</h2>
          <p>For this mini project, I ran into a lot of issues. Luckily there is an abundance of resources online that helped me troubleshoot these issues.
            However, one issue I faced time and time again was a logic issue. For the requirements of this project, my sketches had to still be correct even 
            when the window size has changed. As someone who had fixed positions for every single shape... this was a difficult issue. In hindsight I definitely
            should have learned how to do this from the beginning and set my positions in accordance to the window size. Doing this retroactively meant a lot 
            of additional math and a very large amount of guessing and checking. In the end, I used windowHeight/2 and windowWidth/2 as variables and positioned 
            my elements in reference to the origin or the center of my canvas. Another issue I ran into that I think is slightly relevant is that for the entirety
            of this project, I couldn't figure out why my canvas was missized for every sketch. It turns out, I had set up the canvas with windowHeight, windowWidth 
            rather than vice versa (the correct way).

          <h2>Ideas & Future Work</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Produce sketches with 0 prior positioning
            </li>
            <li>Fully understand the order of events in order to use rotate properly</li>
            <li>Try making a sketch that takes in user audio as input!</li>
          </ul>
